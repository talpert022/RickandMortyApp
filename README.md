# RickandMortyApp

This app gets data from the Rick and Morty API found at this link: https://rickandmortyapi.com/
The app uses a tableview and a search bar to filter characters and then displays character information in a seperate view controller. This second view controller uses a scroll view to display results. Updates on character information and UI design are still required. I also want to at some point implement location and episode searches as well, they are part of the API structure.
